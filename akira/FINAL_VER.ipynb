    "In order to summarize the legal texts, I choose the LexRank model, which is one of the ways for extractive summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to summarize texts using NLP; extractive and abstractive. Since the extractive approach chooses sentences from the original text, it is less likely to create an incomprehensible summary and less likely to output a gramatically incorrect summary. However, in the extractive approach, you cannot use words that are not in the original text, so it is not possible to paraphrase or to use conjunctions to make summary more easy to read. In contrast, the abstractive allows you to summarize more flexibly because you are free to use words that are not in the original sentences. In addition, you can choose the length of summary. However, the disadvantage in this approach is that it is difficult to produce \"natural\" sentences. For this project, I decided to take the extractive way to ensure that important information is included in the summary of the legal documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LexRank model works almost the same as Google Search -- it uses sentences as a node and similarity as edge/weight. For details, please refer to [Erkan and Radev (2004)](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/JAIR/Vol22/JAIR-2214.pdf)."

       "\"CROSS, Judge. The record in this case shows that the plaintiff in error [Frederick Fletcher] brought an action of trespass on the case against the. defendant [William Ellis], in the Conway circuit court, and in his declaration alleged โthat the said plaintiff and one Alexander Rogers, were indebted to Daniel Gilmore in a large sum of money, namely,' in the amount of fifty-five dollars, upon which said Gilmore had brought suit and obtained judgment, and sued out execution against the plaintiff and the said Rogers, and the plaintiff avers that he and Rogers had, in the county of Conway, sufficient goods and chattels to have satisfied the execution, and the plaintiff avers that the defendant being an evil disposed person, fond of encouraging litigation and fomenting strife, and wishing to harass, impoverish, and distress the plaintiff, did, on the first day of October, 1834, at the county of Conway, and within the jurisdiction of this court, maliciously persuade and procure the said Daniel Gilmore, by offering him to pay all costs and charges, and to see his debt made secure, to have the plaintiff's body taken in execution; and by reason of the defendantโs procurements by his several offers and promises as aforesaid made, the plaintiffโs body was taken in execution.โ It also appears that the defendant filed a demurrer to the declaration, which was sustained by the court. The writ of error is prosecuted to reverse the judgment sustaining the demurrer. A mere glance at the declaration will show that it has been drawn by an extremely careless pleader. The object of the action doubtless was, to charge the defendant for a maintenance, which is defined to be an officious intermeddling in a suit depending in a court, with which the person so intermeddling has nothing to do, by assisting the plaintiff or defendant in the prosecution of such suit. Co. Litt. 358; 2 Inst. 213. The court is not designated in which the suit was pending, nor is the time or place alleged when arid where the execution issued or into whose hands it came. The allegation is in relation to the maintenance, that the defendant offered Gilmore to pay costs and charges, and to see that his debt was secured. Between a mere offer to assist and assistance, there is certainly a material difference, for without the latter, the maintenance is not committed at all. So far as anything can be collected on the subject from the declaration, it seems that at the time the offer was made to pay costs and see the debt secured, an execution was rightfully in the hands of an officer of some kind, and the plaintiff and Rogers had a sufficiency of property in the county to satisfy it If so, the defendantโs offers were made in relation to a matter over which neither he nor Gilmore had any control, as the officer was legally bound in the first place, to levy on and dispose of the property in satisfaction of the writ, notwithstanding the plaintiff in execution might have instructed him to arrest the body of the defendant That an action lies in this country for maintenance, we entertain but little doubt Tet it certainly would be necessary, in order to sustain such an action, to allege not only the pendency of a suit but designate the particular court in which it was depending, together with time and circumstances, none of which requisites exist in the case before ns. Indeed, there is scarcely a single requisite stated necessary to constitute a maintenance, and we have seldom had occasion to examine a declaration in which there was so frail a cause of action set forth. Judgment affirmed.\""

      "Original Headnote:  Bank of Malvern v. Burton. Opinion delivered February 10, 1900. 1. UsuryโRenewal Note.โWhere the note sued on was the last of a series of usurious notes given in renewal of a note untainted with usury, plaintiff was entitled to amend the complaint so as to recover on the original note. (Page 429.) 2. PleadingโAmendment to Conform to Proof.โWhere no objection was taken to the admission of evidence that the note sued on was given in renewal of a valid note, the complaint was properly treated by the trial court as amended to conform to the proof. (Page 429.) Appeal from Hot Springs Circuit Court. Alexander M. Duffie, Judge. JS. M. Vance, Jr., for appellant. It was error to strike appellantโs reply from the files. 44 S. W. 393; 99 N. Car. 107. The usury, if any, in the renewal notes did not affect the consideration, which was free from usury. Hence the pleadings should have been considered amended by the proof, and judgment given for the original debt. 29 Ark. 323; 42 Ark. 57; 55 Ark. 143; 56 Ark. 334; 35 Ark. 217; 98 N. Car, 107; 27 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, 946-7. Jesse B. Moore, for appellee. The court was correct in sustaining the motion to strike. 33 Ark. 56, 593; 44 Ark. 293; 48 Ark. 238. Since the first note was usurious and void, the debt is destroyed. 53 Ark. 271; 56 Ark. 143, 146. The court below had the right to disregard incompetent and irrelevant evidence, and it was its duty to do so. 42 Ark. 310; 4 Ark. 251. It was discretionary with the court to treat the complaint as amended or not. 22 Ark. 164; 23 Ark.โ735; 54 Ark. 444. The evidence as to the debt was irrelevant, under the pleading. 46 Ark. 96. \n",

County ConvictโPer Diem Allowance.โThe act of April 12,1899 (? 3), relating to county convicts, which amended the act of March 13,1883, upon the same subject by increasing the per diem allowance of a county convict delivered to the county contractor from 50 cents to 75 cents per day was not intended to be retroactive, nor to apply to the case of one convicted prior to its passage. (Page 583.)\" Appeal from Jefferson Circuit Court. Antonio B. Grace, Judge. STATEMENT BY THE COURT. Petition by appellee for habeas corpus, alleging as follows: On the 6th of April, 1899, appellee was convicted of an assault in the court below, and fined $50, making, with the costs, $109. On the 11th of the month she was committed to the custody of R. R. Adams, contractor for county prisoners of the county, where she has continuously served at hard labor; and she is entitled to credit in the month of April 19 days, May 31 days, June 30 days, July 31 days, August 31 days and September 11 days, in all 153 days, which at 75 cents a day, amounts to $114, or $4.35 more than the amount due. Adams answered as follows: Defendant entered into contract with the county judge of the county for keeping county prisoners from January 1, 1899, to January 1, 1900. He was to pay all costs of conviction of prisoners; to pay five and a half cents a day for their labor; and to provide them with proper food and clothing, and with medical attendance. Adams gave bond accordingly. He says appellee worked 84 and one-half days, and lost, on account of bad weather, Sundays, and sickness, 51 and a quarter days. Appellee was not allowed for time thus lost; but for the time that she labored she was allowed 50 cents a day, making $45.12|-; a statement which was admitted by the petitioner. The court allowed petitioner for the full time claimed 153 days, at 75 cents a day, and discharged her. Motion for a new trial was filed by the appellant, raising all questions of law. It was overruled, and appellant excepted. An appeal was prayed and granted. Jeff Davis, Attorney General, Ghas. Jacobson, W. B. Sorrells, Prosecuting Attorney, and Bose, Hemingivay Bose, for appellant. The amended statute of 1883 supersedes the statutes of 1877 and 1881, aud fixes the amount to be allowed prisoners per diem at fifty cents. Compare Act March 10, 1877, (Sand. & H. Dig., ยง 899), ยง 4; Acts 1881, p. 150, sec. 5; Acts 1883, p. 126, secs. 3 and 5. That the latter act repeals the former, see: Endlieh, Stat. Const ยง 196; 67 N. Y. 109; 49 N. Y. 332; Holmes, 245, S. C. Fed. Cas. No. 17,247; 143 U. S. 18; 65 Ark. 210. In allowing compensation by the day, Sundays are not to be counted. 58 Ark. 620; 92 Ala. 96; 77 id. 597; 12 Ga. 100; 8 Mete. 496; 26 Enc. Law, 14. The act of 1899 has no application, because it has no retroactive effect. 56 Ark. 495. Habeas corpus cannot be made to perform the office of an appeal or writ of error. Hurd, Hab. Corp. ch. 6, ยง 2; 166 U. S. 552. \n",

    "In [Farzindar and Lapalme (2004)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1006.pdf), thematic segmentation by linguistic markars is introduced as a way to more easily summarize legal documents. This is because we can follow the structure of legal documets, and we are less likely to miss important information. I tried to implement the thematic segmentation, but I observed, for example, linguistic markars for conclusion in the beginning of a legal document. Therefore, I decided not to use thematic segmentation for summarization."
