    "In order to summarize the legal texts, we also test the LexRank model, which is one of the ways for extractive summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to summarize texts using NLP; extractive and abstractive. Since the extractive approach chooses sentences from the original text, it is less likely to create an incomprehensible summary and less likely to output a gramatically incorrect summary. However, in the extractive approach, you cannot use words that are not in the original text, so it is not possible to paraphrase or to use conjunctions to make summary more easy to read. In contrast, the abstractive allows you to summarize more flexibly because you are free to use words that are not in the original sentences. In addition, you can choose the length of summary. However, the disadvantage in this approach is that it is difficult to produce \"natural\" sentences. For this project, we decided to take the extractive way to ensure that important information is included in the summary of the legal documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LexRank model works almost the same as Google Search -- it uses sentences as a node and similarity as edge/weight. For details, please refer to [Erkan and Radev (2004)](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/JAIR/Vol22/JAIR-2214.pdf)."

       "'MORRIS, Chief Judge. The sole issue on appeal is whether claimants, were discharged because of misconduct associated with their work and are thus disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. Findings of fact of the Commission are conclusive if supported by the evidence, and judicial review is limited to determining whether errors of law have been committed. G.S. 96-15(i). The findings of fact to which appellant excepts are as follows: 5. The employer alleged they were discharged as a result of having found gambling for money while on company property and during a work day. 6. Each of the parties (claimants) involved denies having done any gambling for money. Each party (claimant) does agree that they were playing cards for a game or two, but not with any betting for money involved. Someone had found an incomplete deck of cards and while waiting for job assignments the four claimants fooled around playing a hand or two of cards. 7. The claimants were not playing cards for money and were not therefore gambling as the employer alleged. An employer witness stated that he thought they were gambling, but had not seen any money being passed. He had only observed washers on what might have been used as a card table. We hold that these findings are fully supported by the testimony given at the hearing and reflected in the record. The findings of fact are, therefore, binding on appeal. We hold, furthermore, that the facts support the Commissionโs conclusion that the claimants were not discharged for misconduct in connection with their work. An employee will be disqualified for benefits if it is determined that he was discharged for misconduct connected with his work. G.S. 96-14(2). โMisconductโ as. that word is used in unemployment compensation law has been defined as . . . conduct evincing such wilful or wanton disregard of an employerโs interest as is found in deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of his employee. . . .

Neubeck, 237 Wis. 249, 259, 296 N.W. 636, 640 (1941), where the Wisconsin Court noted that โmere inefficiency, unsatisfactory conduct . . . are not to be deemed โmisconductโ . . .โ. Id. at 260, 296 N.W. at 640. The facts support a conclusion that there was no wilful or wanton disregard of the employerโs interest. Claimants were accused of and discharged for gambling. There is no evidence that the menโs card playing amounted to gambling, however. Appellant made no showing that money was passed, or that the washers on the make-shift table around which the employees sat had any value, or that they represented something of value. Appellant argues that its rule against gambling need not be limited to gambling for money. Every definition adduced by the parties depicts gambling as a game of chance in which money or something of value is at stake, however. The criminal offense of gambling in North Carolina, for example, is described as โany game of chance at which any money, property, or other thing of value is bet.โ G.S. 14-292. There is absolutely no evidence that the claimantsโ play was for anything, tangible or intangible, of value or exchangeable for value. It is clear from the record and briefs that gambling among employees is prohibited by Walter Kidde and Company, Inc. Card playing, though perhaps undesirable at the workplace, was not explicitly prohibited. Claimantsโ conduct, therefore, violated no rule, and the Commission could legitimately conclude that claimants were not engaged in conduct evincing substantial disregard for the standard of behavior to which they were expected to adhere. The judgment of the Superior Court is, for the reasons stated above, Affirmed. Judges Vaughn and Martin (Harry C.) concur.'"

Same โ State Grants โ Deeds and Conveyances โ ColorโPlaintiffโs Evidence. Where the plaintiffโs own evidence, in an action of trespass on lands involving title, tends to show sufficient adverse possession of the defendant under color to take the title out of the State and ripen it in defendant, or in one under whom he claims, and the plaintiff is claiming the locus in quo by grant from the State, issued after the title had ripened, he cannot recover.

      "Original Headnote:  D. H. MARSHBURN et als. v. ISAAC JONES et als. (Filed 27 November, 1918.) 1. Statutes โ StockโNo-Fence Law โ โChange of Fence.โ The requirement of Revisal, sec. 1675, that the counties therein named may withdraw from the operation of the no-fence law, upon the conditions specified therein, if funds are provided by a tax levy, etc., for โchanging the fence,โ is to provide against trespass by the running at large of stock into no-fence territory, and contemplates the change from the one system to the other; and the position is untenable that the statute is inapplicable when the fence has long since been lawfully removed or destroyed. 2. Statutes โ Repealing Statutes โ ConflictโStockโNo-Fence Law โ Fences. Where a statute amends Revisal, sec. 1675, by adding a part of another county to those therein named as having the right to withdraw from the stock law under certain conditions, and makes the .building of the fence around the outer boundaries of the proposed district a condition precedent to the exercise of this right, repealing conflicting laws, the condition imposed by the later statute is not in conflict with the provisions of the section of the Revisal requiring that the expense of the fence be met by a tax levy, etc. 3. Statutes โ Public Policy โ StockโNo-Fence Law โ Fences. Our public policy with respect to the running of stock at large has been-changed by our statutes on the subject of โno-fenceโ or stock laws, and the uniformity, with slight exception, of their application to the entire State; and while Revisal, sec. 1675, permits the counties therein enumerated to withdraw, upon certain conditions, from โstock-lawโ territory, this is to be done with regard to the rights of those districts where the law is effective, requiring that the districts withdrawing therefrom shall erect the boundary fences necessary to keep tbe stock from trespassing upon tbe rights of tbe larger class of people within tbe โno-fenceโ territory. 4. Statutes โ Repealing Statutes โ ConflictโStockโFencesโNo-Fence Law. The act of 1917, placing Pender County among those specified in Re-visal, see. 1675, as having the right to withdraw from stock-law territory, etc., by repealing all laws in conflict therewith, does not affect the provision in the Public-Local Laws of 1915 relating to Pender County, and requiring as a condition precedent that, before its operative effect, a fence shall be built around the defined district. 5. Injunction โ Public Policy โ Multiplicity of Suits โ StockโNo-Fence Law. Where a proposed โno-fenceโ district has' not been established according to the statute (Revisal, sec. 1675), equitable relief by injunction will lie against those who permit their stock to run at large and trespass upon the rights of others, upon the ground that such is against the well settled policy of the State; and that multiplicity of suits will be prevented. Hoke and Allen, JJ., dissent. Th-is is an appeal by defendants from tbe order of Stacy, J., continuing to tbe bearing a restraining order against tbe defendants allowing tbeir live-stock to run at large in Pender County, wbicb was beard by consent of all parties at Wilmington, 8 July, 1918.

    "In [Farzindar and Lapalme (2004)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1006.pdf), thematic segmentation by linguistic markars is introduced as a way to more easily summarize legal documents. This is because we can follow the structure of legal documets, and we are less likely to miss important information. We tried to implement the thematic segmentation, but we observed, for example, linguistic markars for conclusion in the beginning of a legal document. Therefore, we decided not to use thematic segmentation for summarization."
